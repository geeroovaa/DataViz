## Data Visualization Final Project

### Team Members:
Gerardo Rodríguez (grv232)  
Julián Ferreiro (jif245)

### Objectives of the project:
Gentrification in cities refers to the process where low income groups are displaced and replaced by higher income groups. 
This constitutes a problem because this lower income groups then need to incur in higher cost both when searching a new home and also for being relocated to areas that have less access to jobs or that have less facilities nearby.


### Data set involves
The map was build using an index of gentrification developed by Karen Chapple.
This index created different categories of gentrification risk using data available in the American Community Survey Census.
This information was at the census tract level.

Since census tract is highly granular level, it was decided to aggregate the data to neighborhood. 
The neighbourhood level is more meaningful to a policy maker: it constitues a category that is common knowledge for newyorkers and is what is used to analyze political variables like PlanNYC projects, voting results, etc.
